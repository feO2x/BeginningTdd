# BeginningTdd
This repository contains examples that can be used to learn and teach Test-Driven-Development.

I recorded a screen-cast when I started creating the List<T> implementation with TDD - unfortunately I'm not finished yet. I will update this repo with the corresponding YouTube links to the videos once I'm finished.
